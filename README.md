**Klutter Tools** is a collection of Unity Editor extensions offering various
utilities to enhance the editor workflow.

## Features

Currently, the package includes the following features:

### FPS capper

**FPS Capper** allows you to set preferences for limiting the frame rate in the
Unity Editor. This is particularly useful when editing VFX Graphs in Edit Mode,
as V-Sync settings are ignored in this mode, which can lead to unnecessary
energy consumption, heat and fan noise.

### Zoom step scaling in VFX Graph Editor

This feature provides a preference setting to customize the zoom step scaling
in the VFX Graph Editor. It's especially helpful for Mac users with a trackpad,
where scroll gestures can feel overly sensitive and make precise editing
difficult.

### .cube LUT file import

Adds support for importing `.cube` LUT (Look-Up Table) files, commonly used in
video editing software. While this feature is natively available in HDRP, itâ€™s
beneficial for users who want to use it in URP.
